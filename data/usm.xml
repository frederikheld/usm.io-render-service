This document describes structure and content of an User Story Map.

The map is defined within the element <usm />

At first you define the structure of the map by defining releases.
Each release has at least a <name />, which summarizes the scope of the release
and an <id />, which will be used in the body to assign a card to a realease.

Next section is <backbone />, which defines the structure of the User Story Map.
The base element is the <step />, which is a card above the timeline.
The order of the <step />s defineds the order in which they are rendered on the horizontal axis.

Each <step /> has a <body />, wich contains all <card />s in this <step />.
The <card />s will be rendered on a vertical axis below the <step /> starting below the timeline.
A <card /> can be assigned to a spcific release by adding an attribute "release" whose value
is the <id /> of one of the <release />s whe have defined in the <roadmap /> section.
The order of the cards with the same "release" attribute determines the order in wich they
will be rendered.
<card />s without a specified release or with a specified release that doesn't exist
will rendered at the bottom of the User Story Map.

Each <card /> has a <title />, which will be rendered on the card and a <description />, which will be
rendered as the card is selected.
