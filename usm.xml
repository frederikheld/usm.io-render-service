This document describes structure and content of an User Story Map.

The map is defined within the tags <usm />

At first you define the structure of the map by defining releases.
Each release has at leas a <name />, which summarizes the scope of the release
and an <id /> which will be used in the items to assign a story to a realease.

Next section is <items /> which contains the content of the User Story Map.
The base element is the <epic />, which defines the timeline of the map.
The order of the <epic />s defineds the order in which they are rendered on the timeline.

Each <epic /> can contain different kinds of backlog items which are grouped in the <items /> section.
The <items /> section is structured in <release />s, that resemble the <release />s
that we have previously defined in the <roadmap /> section.
To name the spcific release, a <release /> need to have the attribute "id" that refers to the <id /> defined before.

Inside the <release />s the backlog items are defined.
The different items have the same structure but are rendered different according to the stylesheet.
Right now there's only the <story /> item.
The order if the items within each <release /> defines their priority
and therefore the order in which they will be rendered.

Each item has a <title />, which will be rendered on the card and a <description />, which will be
rendered if the card is selected.
